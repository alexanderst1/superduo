#### Super Duo - UX Review

##### User Feedback for Alexandria:

Lauren says:
> "I like this app generally, and the speed at which books come up on my phone after I enter the ISBN is awesome. I’m frustrated that the scanning functionality isn’t implemented yet. That would speed up the whole process and make the app way more useful for me."

Josh says:
> "This app is terrible. They say you can scan books, but that functionality isn’t in the app yet. It also crashed on me when I tried to add the book my sister was reading on the flight to London."

Hsiao-Lu says:
> "The app could use some work. Sometimes when I add a book and don’t double-check the ISBN, it just disappears!"

##### User Feedback for Football Scores:

Your Boss says:
> "It's important to always use an API key when you can. Get your own API key and put it into the strings.xml file."

Stefan says:
> "This app took me a while to figure out, but it is totally worth it! It helps me keep track of when to be glued to my TV, and keeps me up to date when I’m not."

Moizeé says:
> "I have trouble navigating and understanding this app. It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

Jennie says:
> "I like the functionality of this app, but I hate having to open it up every time I want to check for a new game. Can’t you put something on the home screen for us?"
